## Few things to remember in Java Programming Basics

> 1. keywords are case sensitive. keywords are all lowercase. keywords are reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, and loop labels).
> 1. Variables are case sensitive. Variables are user-defined names that represent storage locations in the computer's memory. Variables can be used to store data of different types.
> 1. Identifiers are case sensitive. Identifiers are user-defined names that represent classes, methods, variables, packages, and interfaces.
> 1. Data types are case sensitive. Data types are keywords that specify the type of data that a variable can store. Java is a strongly typed language. All variables must be declared before they can be used.
> 1. Constants are case sensitive. Constants are user-defined names that represent fixed values that cannot be changed during the execution of a program.
> 1. Comments are case sensitive. Comments are used to document a program. Comments are not executed by the compiler or the interpreter.
> 1. Primitive data types are case sensitive. Primitive data types are the basic data types that are built into the Java language. Primitive data types are not objects.
